## Work Process
Once you are setup as a contributor, there are a few things you need to know before you start contributing;

1. Work will be managed using [Azure Boards](https://dev.azure.com/bmorrisondev/Apostle/_boards/board/t/Apostle%20Team/Issues/).
2. All commits should have `AB#` and the issue number to automatically link issues to commits. IE; `Fixes issue AB#123`. See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/github/link-to-from-github?view=azure-devops) for more details.
3. Code changes should be made on branches of master. Once a code change is complete, submit a Pull Request to be merged into master. This will start the code review process.
4. Comments will be added to lines where a recommended change to the code is made.
